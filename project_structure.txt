The three database tables are:
1. book_database with columns:
id_book	title,author,word_count,page_count,words_per_page,date_published,year_published,author_gender,series,series_number,series_word_count,genre
(Note that some of these columns are calculated from the others)

2. reading_database with columns:
id_read	id_previous,id_book	format,title,author	author_gender,actual_days,estimated_days,date_started,date_finished_actual,date_finished_delta,date_finished_estimate,date_published,word_count,words_per_day_actual,words_per_day_goal,pages_per_day_goal,page_count,series_number,series,rating_horror,rating_spice,rating_world_building,rating_writing,rating_characters,rating_readability,rating_enjoyment,rating_overall,rating_over_rank,rank
(Note that some of these columns are calculated from others, and some are imported from other database tables, so they may not need to be in two different tables for the database)
